## Image Guidelines

### Technical Specifications

- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Quality**: High resolution for demonstration purposes
- **Optimization**: Compressed for web use (keep under 500KB each)
- **Accessibility**: Include meaningful alt text in the JSON files

### Content Requirements

- **Professional Quality**: Stock photo or professionally designed mockups
- **Brand Neutral**: Avoid specific brand logos or identifiable companies
- **Modern Design**: Contemporary UI/UX design principles
- **Clear Functionality**: Interface elements should be clearly visible
- **Diverse Representation**: Include diverse people in testimonial images

### Placeholder Approach

For development purposes, you can use:

- **Unsplash.com**: Free stock photos with appropriate search terms
- **UI Mockup Tools**: Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD for interface designs
- **Placeholder Services**: Lorem Picsum or similar for consistent sizing

## Alternative Implementation

If you don't have actual images, the demo will still work with:

- CSS gradient backgrounds as placeholders
- SVG icons representing the content types
- Text-based previews with proper styling

The demo content service includes fallback descriptions that will display even without the actual image files.
